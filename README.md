# Model for identify which traffic sign appears in a photograph

## Running and installation

* `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install opencv-python for image processing, scikit-learn for ML-related functions, and tensorflow for neural networks.

* `python traffic.py (dataset)`

## Hint

* Run `python traffic.py gtsrb` to test model with gtsrb dataset

If youâ€™d like to practice with a bigger data set you should change `NUM_CATEGORIES`
